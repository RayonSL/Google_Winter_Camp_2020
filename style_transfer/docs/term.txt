The NVIDIA Research AI Playground service enables you to upload images, video and/or sound content to NVIDIA servers, associate your content with other content available, run deep learning or inferencing software on the content, and see and download new content generated. The software and content made available by NVIDIA to you are licensed, not sold.

NVIDIA grants you a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to: (a) access and use the website research.nvidia.com/demos and its subdomains and associated services, (b) use the software and content made available by NVIDIA within the NVIDIA Research AI Playground, and (c) view or download, as available, generated content for your use or distribution.

This license continues even if you stop using the NVIDIA Research AI Playground. The NVIDIA Research AI Playground may offer you ways to access, download, and remove content that has been provided, but make sure to keep your own back-up copies of your User Content. Also, the scope of services is limited and not all content in all formats can be loaded in the NVIDIA Research AI Playground.

You acknowledge that NVIDIA does not manage or control User Content that you upload, access, store, or distribute through the NVIDIA Research AI Playground, and accepts no responsibility or liability regardless of whether such User Content is transmitted to or by you in breach of these terms.

You acknowledge and agree that NVIDIA may, but is not obligated to, block, monitor, scan or review communications or User Content transmitted through the NVIDIA Research AI Playground and that NVIDIA shall not be responsible for the content of any such communications or transmissions but may remove User Content as it deems appropriate, including if content: doesn’t comply with these terms; pose a security risk; doesn’t comply with the rights of others; or doesn’t comply with applicable law, rule or regulation, or the order or requirement of a court, administrative agency or other governmental body.

Last, when using the NVIDIA Research AI Playground NVIDIA may give you the ability to rate generated content. NVIDIA and its affiliates may also use this information to generally improve their products and services to customers.

5. No Warranties
THE NVIDIA RESEARCH AI PLAYGROUND IS PROVIDED BY NVIDIA “AS IS,” “AS AVAILABLE”AND “WITH ALL FAULTS.” TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NVIDIA AND ITS AFFILIATES EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND OR NATURE, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF ANY DEFECTS THEREIN, WHETHER LATENT OR PATENT. NO WARRANTY IS MADE ON THE BASIS OF TRADE USAGE, COURSE OF DEALING OR COURSE OF TRADE.
